# Sefar 

[Sefar](https://github.com/SaadDAHMANI/sefar) is a simple and comprehensive [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) library for evolutionary optimization algorithms, exclusively written using safe code. It supports **continuous** and **binary** optimization in both **sequential** and **parallel** modes through its features. In the current version, the *_parallel mode executes objective function_* evaluations in parallel (multi-threading) using the [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) crate.

## Current state (Under development)

 Sefar supports currently : 

- [X] Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO);   
- [X] Equilibrium optimizer (EO);
- [X] Growth Optimizer (GO).
